    "# 1- Differentiate digit 2 from Digit 7\n",

    "- Select only digit 2, and digit 7 from ziptrain data set. \n",
    "- Project ziprain onto two principal components\n",
    "- Make a scatterplot to confirm wheather or not only two principal components separates digit 2 from digit 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2- Logistic regression\n",
    "- Fit a logistic regression to separate digit 2 from digit 7 over the projected 2 principal components.  Remember in logistic regression, classes are differentiated using 0 and 1 (and not 2 or 7).\n",
    "- Build the confusion matrix on ziptest and check how well the model works on the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2 -Multiple principal components\n",
    "- Project train data onto \"m = 2, 3, ...\" principal components.\n",
    "- Choose an \"m\" so that the classification of digit 2 and 7 is the most precise on ziptest.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3-Differentiate all digits \n",
    "- Project ziprain onto two principal components\n",
    "- Make a scatterplot to confirm wheather or not only two principal components separates all digits properly.\n",
    "- Use linear discriminant on ziptrain over 256 original pixels and build the confusion matrix of this model over ziptrain\n",
    "- Use linear disciminant over \"m\" projected principal components, with the appropriate choice of \"m\" (where the precision of prediction maximizes over ziptest data set).\n",
